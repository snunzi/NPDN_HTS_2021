Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this practical you will learn to import and assess the quality of raw high throughput sequencing sequencing data in Galaxy.

The first dataset you will be working with is from an Illumina MiSeq dataset. The sequenced organism is the unculturable phloem-limited alphaproteobacterium “Candidatus Liberibacter
asiaticus”, which causes Huanglongbing (HLB) disease on citrus. The sequenced bacterium was obtained directly from an infected Citrus sinensis sample in Texas. The sequencing was done as paired-end 2x300bp.

Login to Galaxy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We will be using Galaxy for performing many of our bioinformatic analysis. This is a great free tool for performing bioinformatics, no coding necessary! There are lots of tutorials available online, both on how to use Galaxy and perform specific analysis. See training materials at link below on your own time. 

https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/

.. admonition:: Hands-On: Login

    1. Open your favorite web browser (Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) and login to Galaxy Europe. If not already registered for Galaxy Europe, use this link to register and login:

    2. Once logged in use the following link to access the training queue for this training. This link will only be available during the training, however data will still be available at usegalaxy.eu once training is over.

The Galaxy homepage is divided into three panels:

- Tools on the left
- Viewing panel in the middle
- History of analysis and files on the right

Name History
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Hands-On: Name History

    1. Go to history panel (on the right)

    2. Click on the history name (which by default is “Unnamed history”)

    3. Type in a new name,  “NPDN HTS 2021”

    4. Press Enter on your keyboard to save it.


Upload Data
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Hands-On: Upload Data

    1. At the top of the Tools panel (on the left), click Upload

    .. image:: _static/upload-data.png

    2. Click on 'Collection' Tab at the op

    3. Click 'Choose local files' and navigate to where you placed the folder 'HLB_raw_reads' and select both files. 

    4. Click 'start'

    5. Assign a new name to the collection

Assess Dataset Quality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Hands-On: Assess Data Quality

    1. At the top of the Tools panel (on the left), search for 'fastqc' and click on it.

    2. Choose the collection you just created. 

    3. Click 'start'

Improve Dataset Quality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Illumina sequencing technology requires to ligate adapters to both ends of genomic material to facilitate binding and sequencing on the flowcell. Adapter sequences should be removed because they can interfere with genome assembly. We will use Trimmomatic for adapter trimming and quality filtering.

.. admonition:: Hands-On: Improve Data Quality

    1. At the top of the Tools panel (on the left), search for 'trimmomatic' and click on it.

    2. Choose the 'HLB' collection. 

    3. Click 'start'
