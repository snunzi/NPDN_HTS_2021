Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In metagenomics, information about micro-organisms in an environment can be extracted with two main techniques:

* Amplicon sequencing, which sequences only the rRNA or ribosomal DNA of organisms
* Shotgun sequencing, which sequences full genomes of the micro-organisms in the environment

In this tutorial, we will focus on shotgun sequencing.
